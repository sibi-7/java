Module1- Chapter 6 - Topic: Operators and Conditional Statement
---------------------------------------------------------------

Operators:
    What is the use of operators?
      -- It will perform operations--> calculation or comparison
     5+3-- > 5,3 --> operands
              + --> operator
    Types of Operators
       1. Arithmetic Operators --> *, +, -, /, %
       2. Relational Operators --> ==, !=, <, >, <=, >= -->  5<7
       3. Logical Operators --> &&, ||, !  --> true && true  --> true
    Conditional Statements or Decision making Statements  
       1. If statement
       2. If - else Statement
       3. Nested if else
       4. Laddar ElseIf
       5. Switch Case

Practical Usages:
       1. Arithmetic operators -->+--> total, 
                                   + , / average(percentage), 
              -->  Finance * Accounting
                    totalCost = number or quantity of the product * rate per product
                              =noP*rPP 
   
              --> E-commerce platform
                        finalPrice = orginal price - price* discount rate+ shipping rate
                     
              --> Measurement and Engineering calculation
                             areaOfCircle = 3.14 *r *r 
              --> Calendar - % -->finding the day of the given date etc   
      2. Relational operator
             -->   Traffic control system
             -->   Vehicle speed control system
             -->   User Authentication system.
             -->   Banking transactions  etc


     3. Logical Operators
            --> User Authentication system
            --> E-commerce filtering the products
            --> Traffic control system
        
Day -7 -- Looping, Break and Continue statement
-----------------------------------------------
1.What is looping?
     task(statement) will be executed again and again

2. what is the necessity of the looping statement? or Why should we use looping statement? or what are the advantages of looping statement?
  1. Coding time is reduced
  2. Reduces memory
  3. reusability of code 
  4. readability 
   
2b. when should we go for looping?
         some task(statement) is repeated many times

3. Types of loop
    1. for loop  --sum of all numbers in the list
    2. while loop -->Simulating an ATM Withdrawal Until                         Funds are Insufficient
    3. do---while loop -- exit control loop   --> Asking for User Input Until Correct
4. Difference between while and do-while
5. Break statement  --Searching for an Item in an Inventory
6. Continue statement --Skipping Out-of-Stock Items in an Order List
7. User Defined Functions (Return, Non-return type, Parameterize)

Exercise
--------
1. try to create infinite loop using for, while, do--while

Day-8 - Java Packages
---------------------
1. Understanding the concept of package
2. Types of Packages
3. Advantages of Package
4. Java system packages --> lang, util, awt


Java packages(Folders) 
  --> collection of sub package(sub folders), classes and interfaces.
  --> used to avoid naming problems.
       (Two classes can have the same name, but be differentiated with a package.)

Types of packages
  1. Built-in package
  2. User defined package

Note:
1. Default packages are assigned for enumerations, interfaces, classes and annotation types if no package statement is specified. 
2. One source file can only have a single package statement.

Advantages of Package:
----------------------
  1. Improved organization
  2. Code Reusability
  3. Preventing Conflicts

System Packages
---------------
  1. lang
       -->contains all the fundamental language support classes of Java.

  2. util
       -->contains Java legacy collection classes and utility classes.
  3. awt(Abstract Windowing Toolkit)
       -->contains button and  the graphics classes, including Graphics and Graphics 2D.
Real-time uses of Java packages
-------------------------------
1. Organizing Code in Large Applications

2. Reusing Libraries 

3. Security and Access Control 

4. Web Applications 

5. Namespace Management
